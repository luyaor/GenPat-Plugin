### Usage

*Note: Currently, it only supports with transformation at function(method) level.*

Trace (for the transformation generation):
  
  1. Choose a function (let cursor inside the function).
  
  2. Start with your modification on the function.
  
      Way A: Click *Trace* button in pop-up menu (right mouse click), or `Shift + Alt + -/_`, then edit in popup editor.
      
      Way B: Start with  `Shift + Alt + [` , then edit in IDE, finally end with `Shift + Alt + ]`.



Apply (for the transformation application):
  1. Choose a target function (let cursor inside the function).
  2. Click *Apply* button in pop-up menu (right mouse click) or  `Shift + Alt + =/+`.

Global Search
  1. Click *GlobalSearch* button in pop-up menu (right mouse click).
  2. Popup Editor will show all matched results (contains both before and after changing), Click *Replace* for the candidates you would like to apply.

### TODO

1. Extend global search to all project scope
2. User setting for multi candidates
4. Support with method signature modification
